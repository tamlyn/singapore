Modern - singapore template v1.3.2
by Ross Howard (www.abitcloser.com/projects/singapore)	

Modern is a lightweight xHTML/CSS template for singapore.

It includes gallery, album and image pages, and also has
a built-in slideshow, and full-size image pop-up ability.

It uses common naming conventions (albeit with an sg prefix)
and a clean div structure to allow you to easily and simply customise 
it to suit your needs.

It supports both fixed-width, and scaling page sizes, and is intended to
be web standard compliant and render correctly on a wide range of browsers.
These include Mozilla/Firefox 1.5, Safari, Opera and IE6.

Modern comes standard with a default 'black on black' colour scheme, but also 
includes CSS files for 'white on black' and 'white on white'.

By default, Modern uses the 'Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;' font family, as 
declared for the body CSS. Simply changing this one line will effect the
entire template.

If you make any changes to template.ini please make sure to check the CSS file
too, in case you need to adjust page or thumbnail block widths.
